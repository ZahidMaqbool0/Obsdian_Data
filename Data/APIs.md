## 🧠 Easy Example (Real Life)
Imagine you go to a restaurant:
- 🍽️ You = **Client (Mobile App)**
- 👨‍🍳 Kitchen = **Server (Backend)**
- 🧑‍💼 Waiter = **API**
You tell the **waiter** what you want.  
The waiter goes to the **kitchen** and brings your food.
👉 The waiter is like an **API**.  
It takes your request and brings back the response.
